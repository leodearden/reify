//! Shared by the reify-audit integration test binaries: the git-environment
//! plumbing.
//!
//! - [`git_cmd`] — the constructor every fixture-repo helper should use.
//! - [`decoy_repo`] / [`poison_with_hook_git_env`] — a stand-in for the parent
//!   repository a hook would point at, and that hook's exported environment
//!   applied to a command.
//!
//! Generic git-environment plumbing only: this module is compiled into every
//! `tests/*.rs` in this crate, so a helper hard-coding one script's path, argv
//! or skip protocol belongs in the binary that consumes it. The replay harness
//! built on this plumbing lives in [`super::replay`].
//!
//! Nothing here duplicates a variable list: the *sanitized* set lives once in
//! [`reify_audit::git_env::REPO_REDIRECT_VARS`], and the *poisoned* set lives
//! once in [`hook_git_env`], which asserts it is a subset of the sanitized one.
//! Poison only ever reaches a CHILD's environment: `std::env::set_var` is
//! process-global, so a test that poisoned itself would race its siblings
//! under `cargo test`'s thread-per-test model.
