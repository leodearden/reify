//! Integration tests for warm-state donation/checkout across topology edits.
//!
//! Per arch §4.3 lines 539-540 and §6.4 lines 654-660:
//! - **Donation:** when `edit_source` removes a node from the topology, the
//!   engine donates that node's `cache.warm_state` (if any) to its
//!   `WarmStatePool` keyed by the node's identity.
//! - **Checkout:** when a later `edit_source` re-adds the same `NodeId`, the
//!   engine checks out the donated state and seeds the new cache entry's
//!   `warm_state` slot. A `None` checkout (because the entry was LRU-evicted)
//!   means evaluation falls through the cold-compute path with no seeded
//!   warm state — observable equivalence to a from-scratch baseline.
//!
//! ## Variant coverage scope
//!
//! The donation/checkout machinery is variant-agnostic — `WarmStatePool` is
//! keyed by `NodeId`, which currently has variants `Value`, `Constraint`,
//! `Realization`, `Resolution`. Coverage as of this task:
//!
//! - **Value cells:** full round-trip (donate → pool → checkout → seed
//!   `cache.warm_state`) — covered by tests in this file.
//! - **Realization nodes:** donation hook coverage (variant-symmetry smoke
//!   test). Realization cache entries are not created by `edit_source` —
//!   `engine_build.rs` routes realization geometry ops directly to the
//!   kernel without the cache — so the post-add seed step is a no-op for
//!   realizations today. The donation hook still fires for completeness;
//!   when realizations gain cache entries, the seed step picks them up
//!   automatically with no further changes.
//! - **Resolution nodes:** not in any `diff_*` helper yet (no
//!   `diff_resolutions`); donation/checkout does not fire for them. The
//!   pool API itself is variant-agnostic (verified at unit-test level).
//! - **ComputeNode:** not yet a `NodeId` variant per arch §3.4; coverage
//!   attaches automatically when the variant is introduced (no code change
//!   needed in the donation/checkout path).

// ── Step-5: edit_source donates warm state for a removed value cell ────────

/// When `edit_source` removes a value cell whose cache entry has warm state,
/// the engine must donate that state to its `WarmStatePool` keyed by the
/// cell's `NodeId` BEFORE invalidating the cache entry. This test pins the
/// donation hook on the value-cell removal path (engine_edit.rs ~L1483).
///
/// Test driver: simulate a future WarmStartable producer by injecting warm
/// state into the cache via `cache_store_mut().donate_warm_state(...)` after
/// `eval()` populates the cell's cache entry. Then call `edit_source` with a
/// module that drops the cell. Assert: the pool now contains the state for
/// the removed `NodeId` and a `checkout` returns the original payload.
