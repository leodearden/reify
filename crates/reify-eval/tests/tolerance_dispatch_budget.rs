//! Integration-level smoke for task 2729's `per_stage_tolerance_for_plan` API
//! surface.
//!
//! This file exercises the new `per_stage_tolerance_for_plan` function and its
//! re-export through `crates/reify-eval/src/lib.rs`. It is deliberately a
//! separate `tests/` integration file (not a `#[cfg(test)] mod` inside the
//! crate) so it can ONLY see what the crate actually re-exports — a symbol
//! that is `pub` inside `dispatcher.rs` but missing from the lib.rs re-export
//! line will fail to compile here, locking the public surface.
//!
//! Purpose, per the task plan: pin the lib.rs re-export contract so a
//! downstream caller (the eventual engine/kernel-registry timing-loop
//! consumer) can rely on the entire tolerance-allocation primitive set being
//! discoverable through the crate root, not buried inside the private module
//! path.

/// Integration smoke: confirms `per_stage_tolerance_for_plan` is re-exported
/// through the crate root and wired correctly to `dispatch()` output.
///
/// Three contracts locked here:
///
/// (a) `dispatch()` on a BRep→Sdf→Mesh→BooleanUnion registry produces a
///     `DispatchPlan` with 2 conversions — pinning that the plan shape fed to
///     `per_stage_tolerance_for_plan` matches what the live dispatcher returns.
///     This is the only test site where a real `dispatch()` call (BFS search
///     over a live capability registry) feeds its result to
///     `per_stage_tolerance_for_plan`; in-crate unit tests construct
///     `DispatchPlan` literals directly and do not exercise that wiring.
///
/// (b) `per_stage_tolerance_for_plan(&plan, req)` equals
///     `per_stage_tolerance(req, 2)` — the integration-usage validation the
///     task description asks for ("validated by … integration usage").
///
/// (c) `SAFETY_FACTOR` is value-pinned to `0.8` at the public surface; the
///     canonical contract lives in `tolerance_budget::tests::*` inside the
///     crate. The assertion also locks the re-export path (compile-time).
