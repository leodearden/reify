//! End-to-end acceptance gate for the printer_v01 capstan's helical rope seat
//! (task #5454 — thread-hole δ, dogfood leaf 1; PRD
//! `docs/prds/v0_6/thread-hole-features.md` §6 row 11, re-spec'd by #5580).
//!
//! Compiles the REAL design file `prj/printer_v01/dev_capstan.ri` through the
//! full source → parse → compile(stdlib+checked) → Engine(real
//! `OcctKernelHandle`) → tessellate pipeline and pins two properties of the
//! rope seat cut into the drum.
//!
//! **1. The seat admits the rope (`capstan_seat_admits_the_rope_radially`).**
//! The seat is a HALF-ROUND: the swept section's arc centre sits ON the land
//! surface (`land_r == pitch_r`), so the mouth it opens is the section's full
//! width `2·groove_r == rope_dia` and the rope can be laid in radially. That
//! is the only depth that works. For a circular section of radius `groove_r`
//! centred at `pitch_r` under a land at `land_r`, the mouth chord is
//! `2·sqrt(groove_r² − (land_r − pitch_r)²)`, which is *maximised* at exactly
//! `land_r == pitch_r`: a shallower land closes the mouth over the rope, and a
//! deeper one closes it back under. A radially-admitting mouth is what
//! `docs/projects/printer_v01.md` requires — its service model is "Hours
//! (re-wind capstans)" and its departure tangent migrates axially across the
//! band every revolution, so the rope has to leave the seat radially at an
//! arbitrary mid-band position. #5580 retired the pre-existing `groove_mouth`
//! captive-channel knob for exactly that reason. Re-introducing a radial
//! cut-back of any depth necessarily moves `land_r` off `pitch_r`, which
//! collapses that chord below `rope_dia` — so the mouth assertion catches it on
//! mechanical grounds, whatever the parameter that produced it is called.
//!
//! **2. The seat removes the right stock
//! (`capstan_groove_volume_delta_matches_pi_r2_l`).** The volume the helical
//! seat takes out of the drum blank is checked at two very different
//! resolutions:
//!   1. `PAPPUS_REL_TOL` — the half-round swept solid
//!      `ΔV ≈ 0.5·π·groove_r²·L_helix`, with
//!      `L_helix = sqrt((2π·pitch_r·n)² + groove_len²)` and
//!      `n = groove_len / lead`, within ±15 %. That is PRD §6 row 11 as
//!      literally written (post-#5580). Coarse; this is the conformance
//!      statement, and it is a band rather than an equality because of the
//!      centroid effect below.
//!   2. `HALF_ROUND_REL_TOL` — a centroid-Pappus + end-lens closed form within
//!      ±3 %. This is the regression-sensitive gate. Two corrections make it
//!      sharp:
//!        * the seated half-disc's area centroid lies `4·groove_r/(3π)`
//!          radially INBOARD of the spine, so it sweeps a shorter helix than
//!          the spine does — worth ≈ −3.9 % at the file's defaults, and the
//!          entire reason band (1) cannot be an equality;
//!        * the swept solid's two end caps are flat discs normal to the helix
//!          tangent, so a lens of it pokes past each end of the land cylinder
//!          — but into the retaining flanges, which are solid stock there, so
//!          that lens IS removed and has to be added back (≈ +1.5 %).
//!
//! Why band (2) is ±3 % and not the ±2 % this module carried before #5580: the
//! old budget was written for a correction term worth ~2 % of the swept
//! section (the emergent mouth sliver of a submerged channel). Under a
//! half-round seat the correction is 50 % of the section, so that budget no
//! longer covers it and carrying it over would be a guessed threshold. The
//! three ingredients above reproduce the pre-#5580 kernel-measured ΔV to
//! −0.09 %; a pessimistic budget for the enlarged terms is ≲0.5 %, so ±3 %
//! keeps ≥6× headroom while still catching a real modelling regression (a
//! `groove_r` off by 7 % moves ΔV by ~14 %).
//!
//! **No geometry number is hard-coded here.** Every input to the expected value
//! is read back out of the file's own evaluated cells (`rope_dia`, `pitch_r`,
//! `groove_r`, `land_r`, `lead`, `groove_len`), so a parameter edit moves the
//! gate with the design instead of going stale. That is also why the file
//! exposes `blank_volume` / `body_volume` as `volume()` cells (a legitimate
//! stock-removal metric on a machined part) rather than having the test
//! recompute the blank's closed form and thereby hard-code the blank tree's
//! shape.
//!
//! Why the compile entry is `compile_with_stdlib_checked` and not the bare
//! `reify_compiler::compile` used by the sibling `helix_sweep_e2e` module: this
//! is a real design file, and it needs stdlib-resolved `pi`, `vec3`,
//! `transform3` and `orient_axis_angle`. `compile_with_stdlib_checked` is the
//! entry `reify eval` itself uses (crates/reify-cli/src/main.rs).
//!
//! This module lives inside the `harness_sweep` compile unit rather than as a
//! standalone `crates/reify-eval/tests/*.rs` binary: a new top-level test file
//! would fail `scripts/check-harness-baseline-registration.sh --from-git`
//! (the harness-layout baseline is a shrinking ratchet). `harness_sweep` is
//! also the thematically right home — it already carries #5342's
//! `helix_sweep_e2e`, whose `helix()` spine this design consumes.
//!
//! No other gate compiles anything under `prj/`, so this module is currently
//! also the only regression guard on `dev_capstan.ri` as a whole.
