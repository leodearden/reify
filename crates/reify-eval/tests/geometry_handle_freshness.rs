//! Integration tests for GHR-δ geometry-handle freshness propagation.
//!
//! PRD `docs/prds/v0_3/geometry-handle-runtime.md` §5 + §7.1 (producer-side
//! "Freshness walk: Realization → ValueCell edge"): a value cell holding a
//! `Value::GeometryHandle` has an implicit dependency on the upstream
//! Realization named in its `realization_ref`. Per §5 the cell's freshness is
//! "the meet of (existing VC-input freshness, all referenced Realization
//! freshness)". These tests exercise that meet end-to-end over a real
//! `Engine::build`, asserting both:
//!
//!   (1) the GH cell tracks its backing Realization's freshness directly
//!       (PRD §7.1 boundary row — mark the upstream Realization, observe the
//!       cell follow), and
//!   (2) a `width → Realization → GeometryHandle` cascade drives the GH cell
//!       Pending through the freshness walk's Realization→ValueCell fan-out
//!       (S8) once the cached trace carries `realization_reads` (S10) and the
//!       Realization is recorded as a freshness-bearing cache node on the
//!       build success path (esc-3606-37 ruling step 1).
//!
//! **RED** until S10 wires `realization_reads` into the GH cell's *cached*
//! trace end-to-end and records the geometry-backed Realization in the cache
//! during `build()`. Before that, the param-cell record path stores an empty
//! `DependencyTrace` and no `NodeId::Realization` cache entry exists on the
//! success path, so neither leg of the meet is observable.
//!
//! ## StructureInstance cascade intentionally NOT asserted (esc-3606-37 Finding 2)
//!
//! An earlier draft of S9 asserted that a parent `structure def Asm { sub w :
//! Widget }` StructureInstance cell also goes Pending when `Widget.geometry`
//! does. That is **structurally impossible for this fixture**: SIR flattens
//! `sub w = Widget()` into independent param cells (`Asm.w.geometry`,
//! `Asm.w.width`) that are *copies* — none of them *reads* `Widget.geometry`,
//! so there is no VC→VC edge to carry the cascade. A genuine SI-cascade
//! fixture needs a cell that actually consumes the GH cell, e.g.
//! `let v = volume(self.w.geometry)`, which depends on later GHR phases
//! (volume/query over a `Value::GeometryHandle`). Deferred as a follow-up;
//! the §7.1 acceptance contract never demanded an SI cascade for this row.
