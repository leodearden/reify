//! Per-cell eval commit substrate (task α, #5038).
//!
//! PRD `docs/prds/v0_6/eval-cell-commit-substrate.md` §2.1–2.4, INV-EVAL-1.
//!
//! Defines [`commit_cell_result`], the primitive that performs the four legs
//! of a per-cell eval commit (values, snapshot, cache, journal) atomically —
//! no call path can write a subset of the legs by omission — plus the three
//! enums that make today's implicit choices explicit and typed:
//! [`DeterminacyRule`], [`TraceSource`], and [`CacheLeg`].
//!
//! This module introduces the primitive and its unit tests only. Migrating
//! existing call sites (`engine_eval.rs`, `engine_edit.rs`, ...) onto this
//! primitive is out of scope here — see PRD leaves γ/δ/ε/ι.
