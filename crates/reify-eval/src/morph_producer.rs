//! The mesh-morph producer hook seam (task 4744 β / PRD
//! `docs/prds/v0_6/volume-mesh-realization-and-morph-wiring.md` §4.2, D3).
//!
//! `reify-eval` **owns** this seam — the trait + the borrowing request/result
//! types live here, NOT in `reify-mesh-morph`. That direction is forced by the
//! crate graph: `reify-mesh-morph` normal-deps `reify-eval`, so `reify-eval`
//! cannot normal-dep `reify-mesh-morph` back (a cycle). The morph
//! implementation + `register_morph_producer` live in `reify-mesh-morph`
//! (mirroring how `compute_targets::register_compute_fns` is called at Engine
//! construction); the engine reaches the impl only through the
//! [`MorphProducer`] trait object installed via
//! [`Engine::register_morph_producer`][crate::Engine::register_morph_producer].
//!
//! ## Cycle-free request shape
//!
//! [`MorphRequest`] carries the *constituents* of the old/new BReps as
//! [`BRepSnapshot`]s (graph + values + topology-attribute table + handle
//! slices) rather than `reify-mesh-morph`'s own `BRep`/`MorphSnapshot` alias —
//! those constituents are all `reify-eval`/`reify-ir`/`reify-core` types the
//! engine can name. The `reify-mesh-morph` producer impl re-assembles them into
//! its `MorphSnapshot` before calling `morph_eligible` / `compose_morph`. The
//! new-BRep projection kernel is handed across as a `&dyn
//! reify_ir::GeometryKernel` (the impl wraps it in `KernelProjector`).
