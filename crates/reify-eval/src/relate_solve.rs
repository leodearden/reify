//! Per-scope relate-solve — geometric-relations ζ (task 4386).
//!
//! Given a compiled structure scope (a [`TopologyTemplate`]) carrying, per ζ
//! step-2's threading, (i) a flat source-ordered geometric relation set
//! ([`TopologyTemplate::relations`]) and (ii) a per-`at auto`-sub auto-pose spec
//! ([`SubComponentDecl::auto_pose`]), the relate-solve must:
//!
//!   1. **collect** the scope into the solve's three inputs — the auto Frame
//!      unknowns, the flat relation list, and the grounded anchor set (this
//!      module's [`collect_relate_scope`], ζ step-4);
//!   2. **realize** each relation operand's local datum single-shot (step-6);
//!   3. **partition** the relations into a driving set + redundant remainder
//!      (reify-constraints, step-8);
//!   4. **solve** the driving set for the auto Frame (reify-constraints, step-10);
//!   5. **verify** the remainder as geometry-backed assertions (step-14); and
//!   6. **place** the solved Frame back as the auto sub's pose (step-18).
//!
//! This file lands stage 1 (collection). Later ζ steps extend it; the
//! kernel-free collection logic here reads structurally off the compiled
//! template — no geometry kernel is involved.
