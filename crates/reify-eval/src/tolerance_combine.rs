//! Output-occurrence × active-purpose tolerance combiner.
//!
//! See `docs/prds/v0_2/per-purpose-tolerance.md` ("Resolved design decisions"
//! → "Tolerance lives at the purpose") for the contract that drives this
//! module.
//!
//! # Recognition-shape twin
//!
//! The output-bound extractor below duplicates the `RepresentationWithin`
//! shape-recognition gates from
//! [`crate::tolerance_scope::extract_tolerance_bindings`] (top-level
//! `UserFunctionCall("RepresentationWithin", [<ValueRef typed
//! StructureRef>, <Literal Scalar LENGTH finite>])`). The duplication is a
//! deliberate scope clip for task 2650 — a future shared helper would prevent
//! drift between the two recognition sites at the cost of touching
//! `tolerance_scope.rs`'s public surface (TODO).

/// Combine an output occurrence's tolerance bound with the active purpose's
/// tolerance bound under partial-order "tighter satisfies looser" semantics.
///
/// The two bounds are conceptually different lookups but share the same f64
/// units (SI metres):
/// - `output_bound` — from a `RepresentationWithin(subject, tol)` constraint
///   declared on the output occurrence's template (e.g. `STEPOutput`).
/// - `purpose_bound` — from
///   [`crate::Engine::active_tolerance_for`], computed by the
///   active-purpose subject prefix-scan in `tolerance_scope`.
///
/// # Combination rule
///
/// | output_bound  | purpose_bound | result                |
/// |---------------|---------------|-----------------------|
/// | `Some(o)`     | `Some(p)`     | `Some(o.min(p))`      |
/// | `Some(t)`     | `None`        | `Some(t)`             |
/// | `None`        | `Some(t)`     | `Some(t)`             |
/// | `None`        | `None`        | `None`                |
///
/// The `min`-when-both-Some rule is the same partial-order semantics as the
/// cache-side `tolerance_bucket` (lookup uses the `<=` rule) and the
/// purpose-side `tolerance_scope::merge_with_min`: tighter satisfies looser,
/// so the smaller of two demanded tolerances wins.
