//! `reify-solver-elastic` — Linear-elastostatic FEA solver kernel for Reify.
//!
//! # PRD reference
//!
//! `docs/prds/v0_3/structural-analysis-fea.md` task #7. This crate ships
//! the reference-element primitives (P1 and P2 tetrahedra: shape functions,
//! gradients, Gauss quadrature, reference→physical Jacobian) used by the
//! later assembly/CG/etc. tasks (PRD tasks #8–#15).
//!
//! # v0.3 scope
//!
//! Skeleton + reference elements only. The following are explicitly out of
//! scope for this crate at this stage and are tracked elsewhere:
//!
//! - faer-rs / sparse-matrix wiring → PRD task #9.
//! - Inverse Jacobian J⁻ᵀ for physical-gradient mapping → PRD task #8
//!   (stiffness assembly is the consumer).
//! - `@optimized` registration / engine wiring → PRD task #16.
//! - 11-point quadrature rule for curved-Jacobian P2 → deferred to v0.4+;
//!   our straight-edge P2 elements have a constant Jacobian, so the
//!   4-point Stroud rule is exact for stiffness.
//! - Bridging the stdlib-side `ElementOrder` enum (in
//!   `crates/reify-compiler/stdlib/solver_elastic.ri`) to the Rust solver
//!   types → PRD task #16's job.
//!
//! # Re-export smoke test
