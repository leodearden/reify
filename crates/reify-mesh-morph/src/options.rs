/// solve in PRD `docs/prds/v0_3/mesh-morphing.md` §"Spatially-varying
/// fictitious stiffness". Small elements (near features) receive higher `E_e`
/// and thus absorb less displacement; large bulk-region elements receive lower
/// `E_e` and absorb most of the displacement — preserving mesh gradation.
///
/// The homogeneous BVP `K · u = 0` is invariant under uniform E rescaling
/// (only ratios E_i/E_j matter), so the absolute scale of `E_base` does not
/// affect the solution when `Uniform` is selected. For the spatially-varying
/// rules the ratios between element stiffnesses do affect the solution.
