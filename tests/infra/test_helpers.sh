# Warm-lane test isolation (promoted from test_seed_warm_lane.sh Block R,
# tasks 5590/5612)
#
# Opt-in facility for the warm-lane suites (test_seed_warm_lane.sh and its six
# siblings): mint lane fixtures whose dirname(LANE_DIR) is run-private.
#
# WHY it exists: scripts/seed-warm-lane.sh computes RESEED_TRASH_DIR as
# dirname(LANE_DIR)/.reseed-trash and renames a non-empty <lane>/target there
# before re-seeding. A lane created bare under /tmp therefore makes that path
# the machine-shared /tmp/.reseed-trash — shared across every concurrent
# agent/test run on the host. Nesting each lane under its own private parent
# makes dirname(LANE_DIR) unique per lane, so the computed trash dir is
# run-private. (Task 5384 introduced the pattern for individual fixtures; 5590
# factored it out within one suite; 5612 promoted it here.)
#
# SOURCE-TIME FOOTPRINT IS DELIBERATELY INERT. 153 files in this tree source
# test_helpers.sh and only seven use this facility, so nothing below runs at
# source time except these scalar defaults — no mktemp, no state file, no trap.
# init_isolated_lane_root is strictly opt-in and never runs implicitly.
#
# NO EXIT TRAP IS INSTALLED HERE, on purpose: bash EXIT traps do not stack, so
# a `trap` set in this library would clobber (or be clobbered by) each suite's
# own `trap cleanup EXIT` — silently disabling either this cleanup or the
# suite's, including pool's guarded `sudo umount`s and thin/gc's _BGPIDS kill
# loop. Instead init_isolated_lane_root appends its root to the caller's
# existing _TMPDIRS array, the one integration point that composes with every
# existing cleanup() body unmodified.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Inert scalar defaults. _SHARED_TRASH_DIR is the machine-shared path this whole
# facility exists to keep clean; it is a plain variable rather than a constant so
# a positive-control test can redirect it to a run-private trash dir and prove
# the detectors below fire without ever littering the real path. _LANE_ROOT and
# _TRASH_HITS_FILE are set-but-empty so `set -u` consumers can read them before

# Shared-trash runtime detector
#
# _note_shared_trash_use is the RECORDER: a warm-lane suite calls it from inside
# its run_helper wrapper after every seed invocation, with the invocation's
# captured stderr in $ERR_OUT. scripts/seed-warm-lane.sh logs its
# rename-into-trash to stderr, so an $ERR_OUT mentioning $_SHARED_TRASH_DIR is
# exact evidence that THIS invocation renamed into that path.
# _assert_no_shared_trash_use is the matching CHECKER, asserted once per suite.
#
# THREE INVARIANTS BELOW ARE LOAD-BEARING:
#
# 1. The trailing `return 0` is MANDATORY. The recorder is called as a bare
#    unguarded statement inside run_helper/run_helper_real, so under
#    `set -euo pipefail` any nonzero return here would abort the ENTIRE suite
#    instead of just failing one assert.
#
# 2. State lives in an append-only FILE ($_TRASH_HITS_FILE), not a bash array.
#    Some run_helper call sites invoke the helper inside a backgrounded
#    ( ... ) & subshell, and a bash array append made there is discarded when
#    the subshell exits — silently blinding the detector on exactly the
#    --fresh-checkout-against-non-empty-target runs most likely to reach seed's
#    rename-into-trash path. A `>>` append performed inside a subshell IS
#    visible to the parent shell, so file-backed state fixes this without
#    changing the call convention at any fixture site. A single-line `printf`
#    append to an O_APPEND file is atomic well below PIPE_BUF (4096), so a
#    background job appending while the main shell asserts cannot corrupt a
#    record.
#
# 3. The variable is QUOTED inside the case pattern (*"$_SHARED_TRASH_DIR"*) so
#    any glob metacharacter in the path is matched literally rather than
#    interpreted as a wildcard — an unquoted pattern would fire on paths seed
#    never touched.
#
# _SHARED_TRASH_DIR stays a plain overridable variable (not a readonly) so a
# suite's positive control can redirect it at an isolated lane's own private
# trash dir and prove the detector fires without littering the real shared path.
# When restoring after such an override, restore FROM A SAVED COPY rather than
# re-typing the literal default: a re-typed literal would silently revert a
# future change to the default above instead of tracking it.
#
# ${ERR_OUT:-} rather than bare $ERR_OUT: this library is sourced by 153 files,
# most of which have no run_helper wrapper and never set ERR_OUT at all, and
# reading an unset variable under `set -u` would abort them.
#
# BOTH entry points guard on an uninitialized $_TRASH_HITS_FILE, matching every
# other entry point in this section. Without the guard the recorder's append
# would have an EMPTY redirect target, and under the `set -euo pipefail` every
# warm-lane suite uses the shell exits mid-run with a cryptic
# "test_helpers.sh: line N: : No such file or directory" — test_summary never
# runs and no PASS/FAIL totals are printed. The recorder reports the missing
# init on stderr and still returns 0 (invariant 1 above is absolute); the
# checker returns 1, because a checker that passes on state it never observed is
# the dead instrument this whole facility exists to prevent.

# Shared-trash LITTER guard
#
# The ERR_OUT recorder above only fires when a suite's run_helper wrapper
# captured seed's stderr into $ERR_OUT. Most suites have no such wrapper — some
# never invoke the real seed at all, driving stub scripts instead — so
# _assert_no_shared_trash_use would read a permanently-empty hits file and pass
# VACUOUSLY in them forever. This guard instead observes the FILESYSTEM: it
# diffs $_SHARED_TRASH_DIR's entry set against a snapshot taken at
# init_isolated_lane_root time, so it sees a leak regardless of how seed was
# invoked or whether its stderr was captured.
#
# ATTRIBUTION IS BY THE SUITE'S OWN mktemp STEM — a deliberate trade-off.
# $_SHARED_TRASH_DIR is machine-shared, so a bare snapshot-diff would fail this
# suite for a concurrent worktree's litter. seed names each trash entry
# "<lane-basename>.<pid>", and make_isolated_lane above names every lane it
# mints "${_LANE_LITTER_PREFIX}-lane-XXXXXX", so a prefix test on the entry
# basename attributes litter race-free — the same method that attributed the
# pre-fix entries forensically. That coupling is load-bearing in both
# directions: renaming a minted lane without its stem would silently demote
# every one of that suite's lanes to "unattributed" and the guard could then
# never fail.
#
# THE HONEST LIMIT: attribution covers lanes minted by make_isolated_lane. A
# suite that hand-mints a lane under a name outside its own stem — e.g.
# test_target_per_lane_independence.sh's `$_BEH_ROOT/lane_a`, whose trash entry
# would be "lane_a.<pid>" — is NOT attributable, and a bare-/tmp regression
# there would be reported as an informational note rather than a failure. New
# entries that do not match the stem never fail the suite, precisely so a
# concurrent worktree's litter cannot flake it; the cost is that unattributable
# litter is only ever surfaced, not caught. Route new lanes through
# make_isolated_lane to stay inside the guard's reach.

# CANONICAL WIRING CONTRACT for the shared-trash litter guard (task 5612).
#
# This comment is the SINGLE source of the rationale. The seven warm-lane suites
# that arm the guard (test_seed_warm_lane.sh plus test_warm_lane_pool.sh,
# test_warm_lane_ref_visibility.sh, test_thin_warm_lane.sh,
# test_warm_lane_gc.sh, test_refresh_warm_base.sh,
# test_target_per_lane_independence.sh) carry a one-line pointer HERE rather
# than a copy — a copy would rot independently in seven places the first time
# any of this changed, which is the same duplication hazard the promotion of
# make_isolated_lane itself was meant to end.
#
# TO ARM A SUITE, two edits:
#   1. `init_isolated_lane_root <stem>` immediately AFTER `trap cleanup EXIT`.
#      It appends its per-run root to _TMPDIRS, so it MUST run after that
#      file's own `_TMPDIRS=()` — a call placed before would register into an
#      array the assignment then wipes, leaking the root and every lane under
#      it. The helper refuses to run when _TMPDIRS is undeclared, so that
#      ordering mistake is a loud error, not a silent leak. The root is a plain
#      _TMPDIRS entry, so an existing cleanup() reclaims it unmodified.
#      <stem> must be that suite's own dominant mktemp stem and shared with no
#      other suite: it is what makes litter attributable to THIS suite instead
#      of flaking on a concurrent worktree's.
#   2. Both asserts, on a path the suite ALWAYS reaches. A suite with an
#      early-exit skip path (a substrate gate that calls test_summary and exits)
#      must arm them BEFORE that gate, or they are dead on precisely the runs
#      that take it. Re-assert the litter check after any later block that runs
#      the real seed, so those lanes are covered too.
#
# WHY BOTH ASSERTS, ALWAYS. assert_no_shared_trash_litter alone can realistically
# only ever report "clean" — indistinguishable from a checker that stopped
# working. assert_shared_trash_litter_detector_live is the hermetic control that
# proves the instrument still fires, without writing to the path it defends.
# Neither substitutes for the other, so they stay two independently-reported
# signals rather than one combined assert.
#
# HONEST SCOPE: a FUTURE-regression guard, not a remediation. Task 5607 measured
# ZERO offenders across all six sibling suites, twice — with and without a
# reflink substrate, with a positive control proving the probe was live — and
# forensic attribution of the pre-fix litter found none of these suites' stems
# in it. Nothing here is expected to fire today; it exists so a future
# bare-/tmp lane fails a test instead of quietly accumulating. Attribution
# covers lanes minted by make_isolated_lane; see the litter-guard section header
# above for the limit on hand-named lanes.
