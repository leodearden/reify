#
# Guard for task 6024 (the esc-5848-2 / esc-5893-3 infra-hold class): a
# finite-WAIT slot_acquire deadline must be POSITIVELY identifiable in a verify
# log, so dark-factory classifies it as SEMAPHORE_TIMEOUT instead of guessing
# from a loose whole-output co-occurrence. DF's detector is already deployed and
# line-anchored (`^[ \t]*` + the sentinel, DF task 3679); this suite pins the
# reify-side emission contract that detector depends on.
#
# CONTRACT UNDER TEST (scripts/lib_slot_acquire.sh):
#   On the finite-WAIT rc=75 branch -- and ONLY there -- slot_acquire emits
#   exactly ONE line to stderr whose FIRST TOKEN is at COLUMN 0:
#     <SENTINEL> reason=<R> slots=<N> waited=<secs> disposition=<D> lock=<LOCK_BASE>
#   where <SENTINEL> is the '@@REIFY_SLOT_' prefix followed by 'TIMEOUT@@'
#   (assembled at runtime below -- see SELF-POLLUTION DISCIPLINE). It is never
#   emitted under WAIT=unlimited, never on an uncontended fast-path acquire, and
#   never folded into the existing human-readable deadline messages -- those are
#   dark-factory's OTHER grounded anchors and must stay verbatim.
#
#   Two field-level properties are pinned as their own cases because both are
#   invisible in the happy path:
#     - lock= is TERMINAL. It is the one operator-controlled field, so it is the
#       one that can carry whitespace; last position means a space-bearing path
#       extends the line instead of shifting reason=/slots=/waited=/disposition=
#       out from under a field-position parser (A9).
#     - disposition= distinguishes "the caller aborted with 75" (fatal -- the
#       three wrapper paths) from "the deadline passed and the work ran anyway"
#       (soft -- run_all.sh's pool worker, C). Without it the wire cannot tell a
#       degraded-but-fine pool from a genuine starvation abort, which would
#       recreate the misclassification this task exists to remove, inverted.
#
# SELF-POLLUTION DISCIPLINE (mandatory -- this test must not become the very
# incident it prevents):
#   This file's own stdout/stderr is captured into <n>.out and RE-EMITTED by the
#   outer run_all.sh into the merge-gate verify log -- exactly the stream
#   dark-factory classifies. A bare column-0 sentinel leaking from here would
#   make DF classify the ENTIRE merge verify as SEMAPHORE_TIMEOUT, recreating the
#   infra-hold class this task exists to fix, from inside the fix. DF's anchor
#   tolerates leading whitespace, so INDENTING IS NOT A DEFENCE. Therefore:
#     - the token is assembled at runtime from SP, so it is never contiguous in
#       this file's source nor in any assert description;
#     - every captured marker stays in a mktemp file and is never cat/echoed;
#     - all assert checkers are QUIET grep predicates, so assert's on-FAIL
#       captured-output dump (tests/infra/test_helpers.sh:52-56) stays empty.
#   Same idiom as tests/infra/test_run_all_clock_marker_sanitize.sh:38-42 (CP=)
#   for the @@REIFY_CLOCK_* family; the identical hazard there is a recorded
#   incident (tests/infra/test_test_run_semaphore.sh:61-69, esc-3940-81).
#
# Auto-discovered by tests/infra/run_all.sh via the test_*.sh glob; declared
# `pool` in tests/infra/run-all-classification.manifest (hermetic mktemp
# fixtures, private lock paths, no cargo and no CPU burn).

# run_all.sh a member's stdout+stderr land in <n>.out and Phase 3 re-emits them
# UNCONDITIONALLY (run_all.sh:1785/1799) through a sanitizer that is prefix-scoped
# to `@@REIFY_CLOCK_` (:368, pinned by A6) -- so such a sentinel survives verbatim
# at column 0 into the merge-gate verify log, and dark-factory's presence-anchored
# classifier marks the ENTIRE merge verify as SEMAPHORE_TIMEOUT. That is precisely

# run. The other two reach theirs only under contention this suite must not
# manufacture:
#   - test_test_run_semaphore.sh HG-2 waits on the REAL host-global semaphore
#     with WAIT=0. It deadlines under the MERGE GATE (verify.sh holds that lock
#     across every test pass -- the one scenario where the leak matters) and
#     acquires instantly otherwise. Holding that lock from here to force it
#     would starve every concurrent verify on this host.
#   - test_occt_flock_gate.sh Test 15 sets REIFY_OCCT_LOCK / _LOCK_WAIT /
#     _CONCURRENCY INLINE, so no ambient env from here can make it deadline.
