# scripts/warm-lane-gc-sweep.sh — Periodic GC backstop for the warm-lane CoW pool.
#
# Invokes warm-lane-gc.sh reclaim --mount <worktree_base> unconditionally on each
# run (no disk-guard gate — the point is to reclaim FREE divergent lanes proactively
# to PREVENT monotonic accretion BETWEEN acquires, before the disk floor is reached).
#
# Driven by deploy/systemd/reify-warm-lane-gc.timer (periodic oneshot).
# The on-demand dark-factory ε path (disk-guard check → reclaim → requeue on low disk)
# is separate; this wrapper is the BACKGROUND sweep that keeps the pool lean.
#
# Fail-open: if the warm-lane mount (worktree_base / --mount) does not exist,
# warn on stderr and exit 0 — the timer must degrade quietly on a cold host or
# before the loopback mount is provisioned (inv.6 cold-fallback philosophy).
#
# Stale-trash reaper (task 5326): on every run this sweep also reaps stranded
# $MOUNT/.reseed-trash/<lane>.<pid> dirs — trash that seed-warm-lane.sh's
# rename-then-background-rm leaves behind when SIGKILL'd mid-reseed. An entry is
# removed only when its encoded PID is dead AND no live process still references
# it (cwd / open fd / mmap). This lives in the periodic δ sweep, not gc.sh's
# per-acquire ε reclaim — see _reap_stale_trash below for the reason, which is
# NOT "the /proc scan is too costly for ε": task 5572 moved the lane guard's own
# per-entry scan onto exactly that path, cost measured and accepted.
#
# Live-consumer lane guard (task 5378 → MOVED INTO warm-lane-gc.sh by task 5572):
# this sweep no longer computes a live-lane CSV and no longer passes
# --extra-protect-glob. The guard now lives in the PRIMITIVE, checked per lane
# (and per orphan) immediately before that entry's reset/remove.
#
# Two reasons, both load-bearing:
#   1. Two entry points, one operation. This δ wrapper was only ONE caller of
#      gc.sh; dark-factory's ε reclaim (git_ops.py _run_warm_lane_gc_reclaim)
#      invokes `warm-lane-gc.sh reclaim --mount <base>` and has never passed
#      --extra-protect-glob. A wrapper-side guard could therefore never cover the
#      hot per-acquire path — which is precisely where esc-5375-1 bites. In the
#      primitive, every caller inherits it with no dark-factory change.
#   2. The up-front CSV was itself a TOCTOU. It was computed ONCE and then
#      consumed across a 25-40 minute lane-by-lane traversal, so a lane that went
#      live mid-pass was unprotected. Checking per lane, immediately before that
#      lane's reset and under the flock gc.sh already holds, closes the window.
# The complementary long-term fix — the verify CONSUMER holding ${LANE_DIR}.lock
# across its whole run — is dark-factory wiring (cross-repo seam), filed separately.

#                      once against --mount right before invoking gc.sh; at or
#                      below this floor, --disk-pressure is appended to the
#                      reclaim invocation, engaging the rm -rf <lane>/target
#                      fast-path reset (task 5167) instead of the α
#                      reflink-reseed clone, which stages a rename-to-trash
#                      (frees 0 bytes) then a reflink clone whose metadata
#                      write a near-full volume denies — the reset=N/removed=0
#                      deadlock of the 2026-07-10 outage. Deliberately well
#                      below the γ disk-guard's 50 GiB admission floor: that
#                      floor denies NEW work, this floor stops STAGING a
#                      space-consuming reseed once free is critically low.
#                      A df failure or unparseable measurement falls back to
#                      plain reclaim (fail-to-α: --disk-pressure engages ONLY

# ── stale .reseed-trash reaper (task 5326) ────────────────────────────────────
# seed-warm-lane.sh --fresh-checkout renames a non-empty target/ to
# $MOUNT/.reseed-trash/<basename LANE_DIR>.<pid> then background-rm's it. A
# SIGKILL between the rename and the rm strands that trash; the seed's own
# orphan-sweep only recovers it on the NEXT acquire of THAT lane, so a lane
# never re-acquired strands it forever (observed 224 GB on 2026-07-21). This
# reaper generalizes the seed's single-lane, next-acquire-only sweep into a
# pool-wide dead-PID sweep over the whole .reseed-trash/ dir.
#
# It lives in this periodic δ backstop (systemd timer + hand-run), NOT in
# warm-lane-gc.sh's per-acquire ε reclaim hot path. The reason is JANITORIAL
# SCOPE, not cost: task 5572 put the lane guard's own per-entry /proc scan
# directly on the ε path (~1.9s per entry, measured — see the COST REVERSAL note
# in warm-lane-gc.sh's header), so "too costly for ε" is no longer a reason for
# anything. Trash reaping is pool-wide disk hygiene with no admission-time
# correctness requirement: an ε caller gains nothing from it, and folding it in
# would add a whole extra batch /proc scan per admission for zero ε benefit.
#
# An entry is reaped ONLY when its encoded PID is dead AND no live process still
# references the dir via cwd / open fd / mmap — defending against PID reuse and
# against removing trash an in-flight rm or seed still touches. No per-lane
# flock: trash is PID-keyed crash-orphan state, the guard covers live
# references, and rm -rf is idempotent versus seed-warm-lane.sh's own per-lane
# orphan-sweep. Synchronous rm; fail-open (a failed rm warns and never aborts
# the sweep).
#
# The live-reference guard runs ONCE for the whole batch of dead-PID candidates
# (a single /proc walk + a single /proc/*/maps grep matched against every
# candidate), not once per entry, so a large strand costs O(/proc) rather than
# O(entries × /proc). See live_referenced_paths in scripts/lib_live_refs.sh.
