# scripts/thin-warm-lane.sh — Free-first target-reclaim primitive for the
# warm-lane CoW pool.
#
# PRD docs/prds/warm-lane-pool-sizing-lifecycle.md §9.3 (Pillar C — lifecycle).
#
# FREE-FIRST: removes <lane_dir>/target outright, freeing the divergent
# extents directly — no reseed staged by default (acquire_lane always
# re-seeds from base at acquire time — D10, cow-seeding). Progresses at true
# ENOSPC (a straight rm never needs the transient 2x space a reflink clone
# briefly does). Optional --reseed re-seeds a thin base clone via
# seed-warm-lane.sh --fresh-checkout AFTER the free (T2: free-before-stage
# ordering — never inherits the ENOSPC-deadlock class task 5168 fixed for
# warm-lane-gc.sh).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/thin-warm-lane.sh <lane_dir> [--reseed] [--base <base_target_dir>] \
#       [--seed-script <path>]
#
# Options:
#   --reseed              After freeing target/, re-seed a thin base clone:
#                         <seed-script> <base_target_dir> <lane_dir> --fresh-checkout.
#                         Best-effort: a failed re-seed is logged but does not
#                         change the exit code (see Exit codes below).
#                         Requires --base. Default OFF (no clone staged).
#   --base DIR             base_target_dir to seed from. Required with --reseed.
#                         Per seed-warm-lane.sh's D8 resolve convention, this MUST
#                         be the CONCRETE .gen.N path, NOT the <base>/target
#                         symlink -- thin-warm-lane.sh forwards it verbatim,
#                         unresolved, to seed-warm-lane.sh.
#   --seed-script PATH     Seed primitive invoked by --reseed (default: sibling
#                         scripts/seed-warm-lane.sh). Hermetic test seam.
#   -h, --help              Print this message and exit (0).
#
# Preconditions (caller-asserted FREE is independently re-verified via the
# lane flock — T3; the other two are checked here before any work):
#   lane_dir must exist and be a directory.
#   lane_dir must be under $REIFY_WARM_LANE_MOUNT, when that env var is set.
#   lane_dir must not resolve to (or be literally named) the base dir, and
#   must not be the mount root itself.
#
# Stdout: resolved <lane_dir> on success. Stderr: all diagnostics.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   — target/ freed. With --reseed, re-seeding is attempted best-effort:
#         a failed re-seed is logged (stderr "Re-seed FAILED") but does NOT
#         change the exit code, since the free — the operation this script
#         guarantees — already succeeded (D10: acquire always re-seeds from
#         base anyway, so a lane a caller re-acquires is never left cold).
#   1   — Precondition guard refusal (nonexistent lane, ==base dir, not under
#         $REIFY_WARM_LANE_MOUNT).
#   2   — Usage error (unknown flag, missing positional, --reseed without --base).
#   75  — EX_TEMPFAIL: the lane's own flock is held by a live consumer
#         (ASSIGNED lane; inv.2 one-consumer-per-lane-at-a-time).
#
# Invariants (PRD §9.3):
#   T1 — only target/ is ever removed; source tree / .git / uncommitted WIP
#        are never touched, so unlanded WIP always survives on the branch.
#   T2 — free-first: bytes are freed BEFORE any reseed clone is staged.
#   T3 — the lane's own flock (<lane_dir>.lock) is acquired non-blocking;
#        refuses (75) rather than blocking or stealing an ASSIGNED lane.
#        Assumes <lane_dir>.lock already exists (pool acquire/release
#        convention, inv.2): if it does not, opening it below creates it on
#        the fly, which can itself fail under a truly exhausted filesystem
#        (ENOSPC) before any bytes are freed. Only bites a lane thinned
#        outside the pool's acquire/release lifecycle.

Usage: $(basename "$0") <lane_dir> [--reseed] [--base <base_target_dir>] [--seed-script <path>]

  Free-first target-reclaim primitive for the warm-lane CoW pool (PRD
  docs/prds/warm-lane-pool-sizing-lifecycle.md §9.3). Removes <lane_dir>/target
  outright, freeing bytes BEFORE any reseed clone is staged (T2). No reseed is
  staged by default (acquire_lane always re-seeds from base — D10).

  <lane_dir>              Warm-lane pool lane to thin. Must exist, be under
                          \$REIFY_WARM_LANE_MOUNT (when set), and not be the
                          base dir.

  --reseed                After freeing target/, re-seed a thin base clone
                          (--seed-script <base_target_dir> <lane_dir> --fresh-checkout).
                          Best-effort: a failed re-seed is logged but does not
                          change the exit code. Requires --base. Default OFF.
  --base DIR              base_target_dir to seed from. Required with --reseed.
                          Per seed-warm-lane.sh's D8 resolve convention, this MUST
                          be the CONCRETE .gen.N path, NOT the <base>/target
                          symlink -- forwarded verbatim, unresolved.
  --seed-script PATH      Seed primitive to invoke for --reseed (default:
                          sibling scripts/seed-warm-lane.sh). Hermetic test seam.
  -h, --help              Print this message and exit (0).

  Stdout: resolved <lane_dir> on success.
  Stderr: all diagnostics.

  Exit codes:
    0   — target/ freed. With --reseed, re-seeding is best-effort: a failed
          re-seed is logged (stderr) but does not change the exit code.
    1   — Precondition guard refusal (nonexistent lane, ==base dir, not under
          \$REIFY_WARM_LANE_MOUNT).
    2   — Usage error (unknown flag, missing positional, --reseed without --base).
    75  — EX_TEMPFAIL: the lane's flock is held by a live consumer (ASSIGNED
          lane; inv.2 one-consumer-per-lane).
