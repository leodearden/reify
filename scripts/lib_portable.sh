# TOCTOU note: the socket is bound to port 0, the OS assigns a free port, then
# the socket is closed before returning.  A concurrent process can claim that
# port in the gap between close and the consumer's bind.  This mirrors the
# existing node allocateFreePort() behavior and is acceptable for the v1

# Portable timeout: run a command with a wall-clock time limit.
#
# Usage: portable_timeout <seconds> <cmd> [args...]
#
# 3-tier strategy:
#   1. GNU timeout (Linux coreutils)
#   2. gtimeout (Homebrew coreutils on macOS)
#   3. background + sleep + kill fallback (POSIX-portable)
#
# Returns the command's exit code, or 124 if the command was killed
# due to exceeding the time limit (matches GNU timeout convention).
#
# Sets the global _PORTABLE_TIMEOUT_TIMED_OUT variable:
#   true  — the command was killed by the timeout mechanism
#   false — the command exited on its own (any exit code, including 124)
#
# POSIX fallback termination strategy:
#   The POSIX fallback sends SIGTERM first, then waits a 2-second grace period.
#   If the command has not exited, it escalates to SIGKILL via process-group
#   kill (kill -9 -- -$cmd_pid).  Process-group kill is PID-reuse safe: the
#   command has not been wait(2)ed on yet (the main shell is blocked), so the
#   PID cannot have been recycled.  The process-group kill also terminates any
#   orphaned child processes (e.g. a nested sleep inside a bash -c wrapper).
#
# Ambiguity note (GNU timeout / gtimeout paths):
#   When using GNU timeout or gtimeout, _PORTABLE_TIMEOUT_TIMED_OUT is set
#   to true whenever the exit code is 124.  However, exit 124 can also be
#   returned by the wrapped command itself (e.g. `bash -c 'exit 124'`).
#   There is no way to distinguish these two cases on the GNU path.
#   _PORTABLE_TIMEOUT_TIMED_OUT is only fully reliable on the POSIX
#   flag-file fallback path, where the flag is created by the timer process
#   and the command's exit code is additionally required to be 143 (SIGTERM).
