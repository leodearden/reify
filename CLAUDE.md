# Reify

## Local Dev Setup

The orchestrator verify pipeline requires `sccache` on PATH (install via `cargo install sccache`). `orchestrator.yaml` sets `RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache` and `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` to share a rustc cache across worktrees; rationale and design in `~/.claude/plans/playful-hopping-nygaard.md`.

## Memory Usage

### When to read memory
- **Session start** — search for project context, recent decisions, active conventions
- **Encountering unfamiliar entities** — `get_entity` to understand relationships
- **Before architectural decisions** — search for prior decisions and rationale
- **Tasks with memory_hints** — execute hint queries via `search`, look up hint entities via `get_entity`

### When to write memory
- **Decisions made** — immediately, don't wait until session end
- **Conventions discovered** — coding patterns, naming rules, project norms
- **Session end** — reflect and write observations, summaries of what was accomplished

### Write operations

| Operation | Cost | When to use |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `add_memory` | 0-3 LLM calls | Discrete, distilled facts — **prefer this** |
| `add_episode` | 5-15 LLM calls | Raw content needing extraction — use sparingly |

### Category routing

| Category | Primary Store | Use for |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| `entities_and_relations` | Graphiti | Facts about things and connections |
| `temporal_facts` | Graphiti | State that changes over time |
| `decisions_and_rationale` | Graphiti | Choices made and why |
| `preferences_and_norms` | Mem0 | Conventions, style rules |
| `procedural_knowledge` | Mem0 | Workflows, how-to steps |
| `observations_and_summaries` | Mem0 | High-level takeaways, session recaps |

## Write-Tagging Convention

Always pass these parameters on write operations:
- **`project_id`**: `"reify"`
- **`agent_id`**: descriptive identifier, e.g. `"claude-interactive"`, `"claude-task-7"`, `"reconciliation-stage-1"`

## Task Routing

All task operations go through **fused-memory MCP tools** — not the Taskmaster CLI or Taskmaster MCP directly. This ensures the TaskInterceptor emits reconciliation events for state transitions.

Use `project_root: "/home/leo/src/reify"` for all task operations.

Status transitions (`done`, `blocked`, `cancelled`, `deferred`) trigger targeted reconciliation automatically.

## Session Lifecycle

### Starting a session
1. Search memory for project context: `search(query="project overview and current status", project_id="reify")`
2. Check task tree: `get_tasks(project_root="/home/leo/src/reify")`
3. If working on a specific task, check its `memory_hints` and execute the hint queries

### During a session
- Write decisions and discoveries immediately via `add_memory` — don't batch until the end
- Use `search` before making architectural choices to check for prior decisions

### Ending a session
Reflect and write each as a separate `add_memory` call:
- What decisions were made and why
- What conventions were discovered or established
- Brief session summary (what was accomplished, what's left)

Use `/memory` for detailed guidance on writing effective memories.
